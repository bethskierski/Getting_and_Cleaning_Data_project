==================================================================

This project includes my submission for the Getting and Cleaning Data final assignment. It uses raw data from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset" and analyzes it to create a new, summarized data set as specified in the assignment instructions.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README_assignment.txt'

- 'run_analysis.R': Includes full code that pulls in raw data files to do the following:
    1 - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    2 - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation         for each measurement.
    3-  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the            data set
    4 - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    5 - From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data         set with the average of each variable for each activity and each             subject.
    
- 'run_analysis.txt': Text version of run_analysis.R

- 'tidy_dat.txt' : This is the final tidy dataset, which includes 180 rows (6 activity types x 30 subject), and columns for each measurement type, plus columns for activity name, activity numerical label, and subject.

It also includes the original data files from the data set:

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
